# Projects

**1. Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports**

This folder stores the code for the 6 modules included in the 'Foundations of Sport Analytics' course offered on Coursera.
By no means is it perfect, but it will serve as an example of the work I have done over the course of my journey learning how 
to code in Python! :)

**2. Relationship between Bat Speed and High Performance Metrics**

This was a small project done as an opportunity to practice my coding skills as well as to begin to dive into the newly released open-source High Performance dataset provided by Driveline Baseball. The goal of this project was to try and begin to understand the relationship between select high performance metrics and bat speed.

**3. Investigating the Kinematics and Kinetics of Baseball Hitting**

This was another project done as an opportunity to practice my programming skills as well as to try my hand at using statistical parametric mapping to understand the open-source baseball hitting dataset provided by Driveline Baseball. The goal of this project was to investigate the differences in the kinematics and kinetics between 'fast', 'average', and 'slow' exit velocity groups.
